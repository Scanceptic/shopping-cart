# React + Vite Project
This project used React Router to build a multi-page site, with common components shared between both pages (Navbar, Footer); along with specific components (Shopping Browser, Home Screen). The goal was to create a fully functioning front-end for a storefront using FakeStore API products by creating basket logic and ensuring components weren't uneccessarily re-rendered through careful use of state.
